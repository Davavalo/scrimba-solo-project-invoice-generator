<b>Requirements:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Array to hold services requested</li>
  <li>Buttons to add services to Array</li>
  <li>An area to display data from Array, which updates every time the array is changed</li>
  <li>Only charges once per service</li>
  <li>Total cost stays updated</li>
  <li>Button to send invoice (reset button)</li>
</ul>

<b>Stretch Goal:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Remove Button</li>
  </ul>
  
Additionally, I added a notification area in order to indicate to the user when a service is added/removed or already in the service area (Services Array).
